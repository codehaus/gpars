/**
 * Provides logical grouping for pooled actors. Each group has an underlying thread pool, which will perform actions
 * on behalf of the actors belonging to the group. Actors created through the PooledActorGroup.actor() method
 * will automatically belong to the group through which they were created.
 * The PooledActorGroup class implements the Pool interface through @Delegate.
 * <pre>
 *
 * def group = new PooledActorGroup()
 * group.resize 1
 *
 * def actor = group.actor {*     react {message ->
 *         println message
 *}*}.start()
 *
 * actor.send 'Hi!'
 * ...
 * group.shutdown()
 * </pre>
 *
 * Otherwise, if constructing Actors directly through their constructors, the AbstractPooledActor.actorGroup property,
 * which defaults to the Actors.defaultPooledActorGroup, can be set before the actor is started.
 *
 * <pre>
 * def group = new PooledActorGroup()
 *
 * def actor = new MyActor()
 * actor.actorGroup = group
 * actor.start()
 * ...
 * group.shutdown()
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * PooledActorGroups use pools of daemon threads.
