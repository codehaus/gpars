Adding the GPars jar files to your project or defining the appropriate dependencies in pom.xml should be enough to get you started with GPars in your IDE.

h3. GPars DSL recognition

*IntelliJ IDEA* in both the free _Community Edition_ and the commercial _Ultimate Edition_ will recognize the GPars domain specific languages,
complete methods like _eachParallel()_ , _reduce()_ or _callAsync()_ and validate them. GPars uses the "GroovyDSL":http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/GRVY/Scripting+IDE+for+DSL+awareness
mechanism, which teaches IntelliJ IDEA the DSLs as soon as the GPars jar file is added to the project.
