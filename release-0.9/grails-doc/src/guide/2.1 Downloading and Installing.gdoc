There are several ways to add GPars to your project. Either download and add all the jar files manually, specify a dependency in Maven, Ivy or Gradle build files or use Grape.
If you're building a Grails or a Griffon applicaion, you can leverage the appropriate plugins to fetch the jar files for you.

Please visit the "Integration page":http://gpars.codehaus.org/Integration of the project for details.
