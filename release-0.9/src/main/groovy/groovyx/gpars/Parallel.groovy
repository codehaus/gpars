/**
 * ParallelEnhancer allows classes or instances to be enhanced with parallel variants of iterative methods,
 * like eachParallel(), collectParallel(), findAllParallel() and others. These operations split processing into multiple
 * concurrently executable tasks and perform them on the underlying instance of the ForkJoinPool class from JSR-166y.
 * The Parallel class is mixed-in the enhanced instances or classes and delegates to the ParallelArrayUtil class
 * to perform the actual parallel implementation.
 * The collections returned from collect(), findAll() and grep() are again mixed with a Parallel instance,
 * so they also have the parallel iterative methods available on them.
