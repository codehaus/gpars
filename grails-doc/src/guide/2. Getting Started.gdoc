Let's make several assumptions before we really start.
# You know and love Groovy. Otherwise you'd hardly invest your valuable time into studying a Groovy concurrency library.
# You target multi-core hardware with your code
# You use or want to use Groovy to write concurrent code.
# You have at least some understanding that in concurrent code some things can happen at any time in any order and often more of them at the same time.

That's about it. Let's roll the ball forward.
