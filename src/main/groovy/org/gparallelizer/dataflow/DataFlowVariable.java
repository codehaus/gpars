/**
 * Represents a thread-safe single-assignment, multi-read variable.
 * Each instance of DataFlowVariable can be read repeatedly any time using the '()' operator and assigned once
 * in its lifetime using the '<<' operator. Reads preceding assignment will be blocked until the value
 * is assigned.
 *
 * By implementation/performance reasons this class is inherited from AtomicInteger. Users
 * of the class SHOULD NOT take this inheritance in to consideration, as it can be changed in the future.
 * Changing of this value guarantees totally unpredictable behaviour.
