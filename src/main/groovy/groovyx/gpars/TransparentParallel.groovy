/**
 * Enhances objects by being mixed-in either within a Parallelizer.doParallel() block or after enhancement by
 * the ParallelEnhancer through the makeTransparent() method.
 * It overrides the iterative methods, like each, collect and such to delegate to eachParallel, collectParallel
 * and other parallel iterative methods.
 * The collections returned from collect(), findAll() and grep() are again mixed with a TransparentParallel instance,
 * so their iterative methods are transparently parallel as well.
